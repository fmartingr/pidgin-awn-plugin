Pidgin AWN plugin
=================
I have recovered this project from the [caverns of time](http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-awn-plugin/). Was originally forked from [awn-plugins](http://code.google.com/p/awn-plugins/).

This plugin shows the unread message count from your conversations and changes your AWN Pidgin icon to show your current status.
